# space-dodge-game
Created and developed a Python code using the pygame library for a game where you're a space ship and you have to collect all the coins without touching the aliens.
Once you collect all the coins you move on to the next level where there is more red and yellow squares. It gets increasingly harder the higher level you are on and the levels are infinite.
Each level you pass, the aliens get faster and more aliens spawn.

This project demonstrates my proficiency in game development, showcasing key elements such as player controls, dynamic enemy movements, and interactive obstacles. The game features multiple levels, each challenging the player with increasing difficulty.

All backgrounds and designs are created using Adobe Photoshop by myself, besides the UFO, alien, and coin sprite.

You can find the code in the file "SpaceDodgeGame".
